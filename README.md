# Chingu Explorer Project - FavFonts - Tier 1

This project is a part of Explorer-Cohort-01 from Chingu. The purpose of this solo-project is to develop a webpage per the [Tier 1 specifications](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/soloproject-tier1-favfonts) using **vanillia** HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no usage of JQuery, Bootstrap, etc.)

## Features or Example

*The functionality shown includes the extra (not required) elements listed above.*

## Motivation

After a hiatus of of many years from programming, I wanted to jump back in and learn webdev. I'm using the [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io) platform and this project to bolster my skills and to start a portfolio of projects that I've completed, contributed to, etc.

## ToDo / Requirements (per [chingu-voyages/soloproject-tier1-favfonts](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/soloproject-tier1-favfonts))

*Structure*
- [ ]Header with minor navigation (Logo and Catalog/Featured/Articles/About link list)
- [ ]Nav with Major navigation / page-manipulation (search, custom text, font-size, dark/light mode, grid/list mode, and reset)
- [ ]Main section to contain the font cards
- [ ]Font cards which display the Font Name, the font creator, the sample text, and an add button
- [ ]Footer section with your developer information

*Style*
- [ ]Sample text in each card should be displayed in the corresponding font
- [ ]Buttons/links should be evident (make sure the cursor changes, etc.)
- [ ]Implement a way to handle overflow from sample text in font cards, as the font size is adjustable

*Functionality*
- [ ]Text typed into the custom text (type something) box should immediately change the sample text displayed in each font card
- [ ]The sample text should return to the default sample if the input box (type something) no longer has any input (ex. input == "")
- [ ]Font size chooser should have at least four sizes and should immediately change the sample text font size in each font card
- [ ]Implement the clickable 'reset' icon on the far right of the major navigation; it should make the page appear as if the user reloaded the page (do not actually reload the page)

*Other*
- [ ]Your repo needs to have a robust README.md
- [ ]Make sure that there are no errors in the developer console before submitting

*Extras (Not Required)*
- [ ]Include a back-to-top button that allows users to scroll to the top once the top of the page is out of view
- [ ]Make your design fully responsive (small/large/portrait/landscape, etc.)
- [ ]Implement the light/dark mode toggle buttons
- [ ]Implement the change display icon so you can flip between a grid and list layout for the font cards
